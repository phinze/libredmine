== libredmine

A python library and command line client for interfacing with the Redmine
project management web application


Very early stages now... mostly ideas like this:

  09:21 <phinze> i'm specing out a command line client tentatively called 'rdm'
  that mostly mirrors svn and allows you to check on your tickets and hopefully
  eventually edit them 
  
  09:21 <phinze> i'd like to see something that throws you into $EDITOR with a
  template that you change and then parses it out and sends it back to the webapp
