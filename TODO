libredmine TODO list
------------------------------
lib:
- Ability to sort Issues by Multiple Keys: project, priority, status, etc.
- Write back to server updated tickets?

client:
- Stay alive to store password and fetch again?
- Keep a cache in a tmp file and only update from site periodically?
- Come up with a draft CLI... `red [command]` perhaps?
